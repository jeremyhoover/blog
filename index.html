				Good question! I'm a Minimalist Web Designer, a Graphic Designer, a Web Developer, a musician, a husband, and a soon to be father. I live in the Mid-Michigan area with my wife, Molly, and when I'm not driving her crazy playing absurdly loud music in the basement with my band Solar Collapse, you'll probably find me upstairs obsessing over the layout and typography of whatever web project I'm working on at the time. I'm currently 12 years into my web career and looking forward to where the future takes me.
